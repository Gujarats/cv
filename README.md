# Jekyll Deployment

```shell
$ bundle exec jekyll build
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "publish"
$ git push origin main
```

# Notes

- The value of {{site.url}} should be dynamically changed based on the environment
- the profile picutre is being hardcoded

# Credits

- I'm using mininal thanks to [orderedlist](https://github.com/orderedlist) for the theme
